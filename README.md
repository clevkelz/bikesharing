# Bike Sharing

## Overview of the Analysis

Ridership data from the Citi Bike sharing program in New York (https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html) was evaluated to determine whether a similar program could be feasible in Des Moines, Iowa.  Data from August 2019 were selected for review as selecting a month with warmer weather would result in a more robust set of information to analyze.  The data contained the following fields:
- Trip Duration
- Start Time and Date
- Stop Time and Date
- Start Station Name
- End Station Name
- Station ID
- Station Latitude and Longitude Coordinates
- Bike ID
- User Type (a customer had a 24-hour or 3-day pass while a subscriber was an annual member)
- Gender (unknown, male, or female)
- Year of Birth
